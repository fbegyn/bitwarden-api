# Bitwarden-api

When I recently started a project, I couldn't really find an API that met my
expectation for working with it. So off course, I started my own!

This project is very much a WIP untill the API has been fully implemented with testing.

## Requirements

As it talks with Bitwarden, there are some requirements to currently use this
api:

1. You MUST have the `bw` CLI tool installed
2. You MUST be logged into the `bw` CLI tool

Maybe these will change in the future whenever I figure out how to talk directly
to Bitwarden API
